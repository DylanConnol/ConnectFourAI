# ConnectFourAI
A connect four AI that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and a Neural Network


This program utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search, alongside a Neural Network to find the best solution to a given position of Connect Four

The neural network is trained using an implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search that attempts to make the best move based on the value of 
the leaf being an outcome of a game played by two players moving randomly.
